# Autocomplete
Developed an autocomplete algorithm that fills in user inputted strings based on file input of a provided list of words, using integral machine learning sorting algorithms such as qsort and mergesort, and optimized to run on O(log(n)) worst-case runtime complexity.

autocomplete.h is the header file containing all relevant function declarations
autocomplete.c contains the actual implements code and machine learning algorithms
cities.txt is the test input file
