# Autocomplete
Developed an autocomplete algorithm that fills in user inputted strings based on file input of a provided list of words, using integral machine learning sorting algorithms such as qsort and mergesort, and optimized to run on O(log(n)) worst-case runtime complexity.

autocomplete.h is the header file containing all relevant function declarations

autocomplete.c contains the actual implements code and machine learning algorithms

main.c contains test code demonstrating correct calling of the algorithms in autocorrect.c and debugging purposes.

cities.txt is the test input file used in main.c
